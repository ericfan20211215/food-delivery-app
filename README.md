## Food Delivery App

Full-stack food ordering platform with 6 categories and 30+ preloaded dishes. Users can browse menus, create accounts, manage profiles, and place orders with integrated mock payments. Admins have full control over dish listings, categories, and order tracking through a dedicated dashboard â€” built for a seamless multi-role experience.

## Structure Overview

### **Frontend**
Built with **React** and styled using **CSS**, the frontend utilizes reusable **JSX components** to create an interactive and modular user experience. It manages tasks such as browsing dishes, handling user sessions, and placing orders, all within a responsive UI.

### **Admin Panel**
Also developed with **React**, the admin interface is tailored for content and order management. It provides streamlined access to menu control and order updates through clearly defined components.

### **Backend**
The backend manages how data is handled and how different parts of the app connect behind the scenes. It uses a set of organized controllers and middleware to handle tasks like login, cart updates, and orders. All data is stored and accessed through **MongoDB**.
